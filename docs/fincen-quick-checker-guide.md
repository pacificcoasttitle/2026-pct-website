## What Is the Quick Checker?

The **FinCEN Quick Checker** is a three-question screening tool built into the Pacific Coast Title website. Its purpose is to give real estate agents, lenders, and their clients a fast, directional read on whether a transaction is likely subject to FinCEN's **Residential Real Estate Rule (RRE Rule)** — before the file is even opened.

It is **not legal advice** and is not a substitute for confirmation by an escrow officer. It is a conversation-starter and an early-warning signal.

---

## How It Works

The user answers three yes/no questions. Based on the combination of answers, the tool instantly returns one of two results:

| Result | What It Means |
|---|---|
| 🔴 **Likely Reportable** | The transaction has the core triggers for FinCEN reporting. The agent should loop in escrow early and prepare for beneficial ownership (BOI) collection and ID verification. |
| 🟢 **Likely Not Reportable** | The transaction is less likely to require reporting based on the answers provided. Escrow should still confirm the details. |

## The Three Questions

### Question 1 — Is the Property Residential?
Covers 1–4 unit homes, condos, townhomes, co-ops, and qualifying land intended for residential construction.

- **Yes** → continues
- **No** → likely stops reporting requirement (not residential = not covered)

---

### Question 2 — Is the Purchase Non-Financed (All-Cash or Certain Private Money), OR Does the Lender Lack an AML Program?
This is the financing trigger. Transactions financed by a lender **with** an anti-money laundering (AML) program are typically not subject to the rule.

- **Yes** → continues (cash/private money = more likely reportable)
- **No** → likely not reportable (financed by AML-regulated lender)
- **Not Sure** → treated as potentially reportable (conservative path)

---

### Question 3 — Is the Buyer a Legal Entity or Trust?
The rule targets **non-individual buyers**: LLCs, corporations, partnerships, and trusts.

- **Yes** → likely reportable
- **No** → likely not reportable (individual buyer = typically exempt)

---

## What Happens After the Check

**If Likely Reportable:**
- A red alert is shown with next steps.
- A direct button links to **Talk to an Escrow Officer** (`/fincen/contact`).
- Escrow collects beneficial ownership information (BOI) and verifies IDs.

**If Likely Not Reportable:**
- A green confirmation is shown.
- A reminder to still confirm with escrow is displayed.
- The mini-disclaimer reminds users results are informational only.

## Common "Stop" Scenarios (Not Reportable)

| Scenario | Why It Stops |
|---|---|
| Not a residential property | RRE Rule only covers residential real estate |
| Individual buyer (personal name) | Rule targets entities/trusts, not individuals |
| Financed by AML-regulated lender | Lender's AML program satisfies reporting |

---

## Common Exemptions (Even If the 3 Triggers Apply)

Even if a transaction clears all three questions as "reportable," certain transfers may still be **exempt**. The file should always document the basis for any exemption.

- Easement transfers
- Transfers due to death, divorce, or dissolution
- Transfers to a bankruptcy estate
- Court-supervised transfers
- No-consideration transfers by an individual (alone or with spouse) to a trust where that individual/spouse is the settlor or grantor
- 1031 exchange transfers to a qualified intermediary (note: the sale out of the exchange may still be reportable depending on facts)

**Some entities and trusts may also fall into exemption categories:**
- Certain regulated financial institutions and registered entities
- Governmental authorities
- Certain securities reporting issuers and entities wholly owned by them

*Exemptions can be technical. Always confirm with escrow and counsel.*

## Important Reminders

1. **Results are informational only.** The Quick Checker is a simplified guide based on the rule's core triggers and common exemptions. It does not constitute legal or compliance advice.
2. **Always confirm with escrow.** Details matter — the checker is a starting point, not a final answer.
3. **Document exemptions.** If an exemption applies, the escrow file should note the basis for the exemption.
4. **The rule is evolving.** FinCEN's Residential Real Estate Rule has been updated. Always refer to the current regulation and confirm applicability with counsel.
