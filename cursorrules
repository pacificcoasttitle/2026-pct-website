## Component Patterns

### Page Layout
```tsx
export default function PageName() {
  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen">
      <section className="py-16 md:py-24">
        <div className="container mx-auto px-4">
          {/* Content */}
        </div>
      </section>
    </main>
  )
}
```

### Data Fetching
- Use server components for static data
- Keep data in /data/*.ts files for easy management
- Type all data with interfaces

### Forms
- Use react-hook-form with zod validation
- Server actions for form submission
- Show loading states and success/error feedback

## Don't
- Use placeholder phone numbers (555-xxxx)
- Create components without TypeScript types
- Forget mobile responsiveness
- Skip alt text on images
- Use client components unnecessarily
- Over-animate; keep it subtle and professional

## Do
- Reference pct.com for accurate content
- Test at mobile breakpoints
- Add proper metadata to each page
- Keep the Agent Resource Center as the priority
- Match the professional, trustworthy aesthetic of financial services
